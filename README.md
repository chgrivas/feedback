> An algorithm and data structure benchmark

This repository that contains solutions to common problems that
can be used as algorithmic katas. The solutions are implemented in `Java` & `Scala`.
They are tested using `Groovy` and `Spock framework`.

The long term goal is to gather data structures and agorithms
and propose a way to compare them.
